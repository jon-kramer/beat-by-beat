# Beat by Beat — Judge Card Reference

*Alternate Scoring Paths*

---

## Overview

Judges provide alternate scoring paths that reward focused strategies. Each Judge has a requirement that must be met across all 8 beats of a single round. When claimed, a Judge provides an immediate reward and often an ongoing benefit.

**Pool Size:** 12 Judges
**Per Game:** 3 Judges (2 players), 4 Judges (3 players), 5 Judges (4 players)

**Claiming:** First player to meet a Judge's requirement claims them permanently. A claimed Judge cannot be taken by other players.

---

## Setup

1. Shuffle all 12 Judge cards
2. Deal face-up: 3 (2p), 4 (3p), or 5 (4p)
3. Return unused Judges to the box unseen

Players can see available Judges during the Initial Draft, allowing strategic deck-building from turn one.

## Difficulty Tiers

| Tier | Requirement Difficulty | Reward Scale |
|------|------------------------|--------------|
| ★ | Achievable with light focus | +6-8 points, minor ongoing |
| ★★ | Requires dedicated drafting | +8-12 points, solid ongoing |
| ★★★ | Full commitment, may take multiple rounds | +12-16 points, powerful ongoing |

## Judge Cards

### Style Specialists (5 Judges)

*These Judges reward deep commitment to a single style.*

---

#### Valentina, the Passionate
*"Dance is emotion made visible."*

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Difficulty | ★★ |
| Requirement | 5 Latin + 3 Any (all successfully executed) |
| Reward | +10 points |
| Ongoing | Your Latin moves gain +1 bonus score |

**Strategy:** Draft Latin aggressively. Multi-style cards like Pivot Turn (Latin/Ballroom) help fill gaps.

---

#### Lord Ashworth, the Refined
*"Elegance is not about being noticed. It's about being remembered."*

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Difficulty | ★★ |
| Requirement | 5 Ballroom + 3 Any (all successfully executed) |
| Reward | +10 points |
| Ongoing | Your Ballroom moves gain +1 bonus score |

**Strategy:** Ballroom's Pose and Flow moves chain smoothly. Build consistent mid-cost sequences.

---

#### Ekaterina, the Perfectionist
*"Technique is the foundation. Artistry is the ceiling."*

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Difficulty | ★★ |
| Requirement | 5 Classical + 3 Any (all successfully executed) |
| Reward | +10 points |
| Ongoing | Your Classical moves gain +1 bonus score |

**Strategy:** Classical has excellent type variety (Jump, Pose, Flow, Spin). Synergizes with Type-based Rhythm cards.

---

#### Marcus "Showtime" Bell
*"If they're not watching you, you're doing it wrong."*

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Difficulty | ★★ |
| Requirement | 5 Jazz + 3 Any (all successfully executed) |
| Reward | +10 points |
| Ongoing | Your Jazz moves gain +1 bonus score |

**Strategy:** Jazz is Jump-heavy. Pairs well with Jump-focused Rhythm bonuses. Go for crowd favor with high-cost aerials.

---

#### DJ K-Pulse
*"Feel the beat. Be the beat."*

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Difficulty | ★★ |
| Requirement | 5 Street + 3 Any (all successfully executed) |
| Reward | +10 points |
| Ongoing | Your Street moves gain +1 bonus score |

**Strategy:** Street has unique Pop-type access. Flow-heavy for smooth chains. Moonwalk and Windmill are signature crowd plays.

---

### Type Specialists (3 Judges)

*These Judges reward mastery of a movement type across any style.*

---

#### The Whirlwind
*"Stillness is death. Motion is life."*

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Difficulty | ★★★ |
| Requirement | 6 Spin moves + 2 Any (all successfully executed) |
| Reward | +14 points |
| Ongoing | All Spin moves cost -1 |

**Strategy:** Spin appears in every style but requires 6 in one round. Draft across styles: Pirouette (Classical), Double Spin (Latin), Viennese Cross (Ballroom), etc. Multi-style Pivot Turn helps.

---

#### Icarus
*"Gravity is a suggestion."*

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Difficulty | ★★★ |
| Requirement | 5 Jump moves + 3 Any (all successfully executed) |
| Reward | +14 points |
| Ongoing | All Jump moves gain +1 bonus score |

**Strategy:** Jump is concentrated in Jazz and Classical. You'll need to draft from both. High-cost jumps are crowd favorites—double value.

---

#### The Sculptor
*"Movement is clay. The body is the artist."*

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Difficulty | ★★ |
| Requirement | 4 Pose + 4 Flow moves (all successfully executed) |
| Reward | +12 points |
| Ongoing | Pose and Flow moves cost -1 |

**Strategy:** This requires exactly 4 of each type—no room for others. Classical and Ballroom have the best Pose/Flow distribution. Plan your hand carefully.

---

### Alternative Strategists (4 Judges)

*These Judges reward non-obvious approaches that subvert typical play patterns.*

---

#### The Minimalist
*"Complexity is easy. Simplicity is hard."*

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Difficulty | ★ |
| Requirement | Execute 8 moves, all cost 3 or less |
| Reward | +8 points |
| Ongoing | At end of each round, if you played no cost 4+ moves, draw 1 card |

**Strategy:** Ignore crowd favor entirely. Build a lean, consistent deck. Refine aggressively to remove high-cost cards. You'll cycle faster and score bonuses reliably. The ongoing reward accelerates your engine.

---

#### The Polyglot
*"Why speak one language when you can speak five?"*

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Difficulty | ★★★ |
| Requirement | Execute at least 1 move from each of the 5 styles in one round (+ 3 any) |
| Reward | +16 points |
| Ongoing | Multi-style cards count as ALL their listed styles (not just one) |

**Strategy:** The anti-specialist. Draft broadly, prioritize multi-style cards. You need exactly 5 styled moves minimum, plus 3 more of anything. Hard to achieve but the ongoing reward makes multi-style cards extremely powerful.

---

#### The Machine
*"Never stop. Never stumble. Never fail."*

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Difficulty | ★★ |
| Requirement | Execute 8 moves successfully with no failed executions |
| Reward | +10 points |
| Ongoing | If you successfully execute all 8 moves in a round, +3 points |

**Strategy:** Prioritize Stamina actions. Build smooth cost chains. Avoid risky high-cost moves without setup. The ongoing reward gives +3 per perfect round—potentially +15 over a game.

---

#### The Showstopper
*"They came to see a star. Give them one."*

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Difficulty | ★★★ |
| Requirement | Win crowd favor (outright, not style-matched) 4 times in one round |
| Reward | +12 points |
| Ongoing | When you win crowd favor, +1 bonus point (in addition to normal rewards) |

**Strategy:** Pure aggression. You need to beat all opponents 4 out of 8 beats. Draft high-cost cards and chain into them. Risky—you'll burn cards fast. The ongoing reward turns every future crowd win into extra points.

## Strategic Considerations

### Early vs. Late Claiming

| Timing | Advantage | Risk |
|--------|-----------|------|
| Early (Round 1-2) | More rounds to benefit from ongoing effect | Less time to build deck; may fail |
| Mid (Round 3-4) | Deck is focused; higher success rate | Ongoing has fewer rounds to pay off |
| Late (Round 5-6) | Maximum deck refinement | Someone else may claim first; minimal ongoing value |

**General principle:** Attempt Judges when your deck can reliably meet the requirement. A failed attempt costs you a round of suboptimal play.

### Judge Competition

With 3-5 Judges and 2-4 players, not everyone can claim one. Strategies:

| Approach | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| Race for an easy Judge | When multiple players want the same one |
| Pivot to unclaimed Judge | When your target gets taken |
| Ignore Judges entirely | When crowd favor + move bonuses outscore Judge rewards |

A player who claims no Judges can still win through consistent crowd favor and high-bonus moves.

### Synergies

| Judge | Strong Synergy With |
|-------|---------------------|
| Valentina (Latin) | Rhythm cards favoring Step type |
| Ekaterina (Classical) | Rhythm cards favoring Jump, Pose, or Flow |
| The Whirlwind (Spin) | Multi-style cards with Spin type |
| The Minimalist | Aggressive Refinement; small deck cycling |
| The Machine | Stamina-heavy recovery; conservative chains |
| The Showstopper | High-cost moves; chain discount Rhythm cards |

---

## Edge Cases

| Situation | Resolution |
|-----------|------------|
| Multi-style card for style requirement | Counts as ONE of its listed styles (player chooses) |
| Multi-style after claiming The Polyglot | Now counts as ALL listed styles |
| Stumble card for The Minimalist | Stumble has cost 0, which is ≤3, so it counts |
| The Machine + forced Stumble | Stumble is not a "failed execution"—it executes at cost 0. Still counts as success |
| Tie for first to meet requirement | If revealed simultaneously, tied players both fail to claim (try again next round) |
| Style-specialist + multi-style ongoing bonus | Multi-style cards don't gain the +1 bonus (e.g., Latin ongoing only affects pure Latin cards) |

---

## Variant: Judge Drafting

For more strategic control, try this variant:

1. Reveal all 12 Judges
2. Starting with a random player, each player drafts 1 Judge (this is "their" Judge to pursue)
3. Remaining Judges are available to anyone
4. A player's drafted Judge gives +2 bonus points if they claim it

This reduces racing and ensures everyone has a path, while still allowing opportunistic claims of undrafted Judges.

---

## Design Notes

### Why These Numbers?

| Requirement | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------|
| 5 [Style] + 3 Any | With ~4-5 cards of target style drafted + multi-style, achievable in 2-3 rounds of prep |
| 6 [Type] + 2 Any | Types are spread across styles; requires cross-style drafting |
| 4 + 4 split | Exact constraint creates hand-planning puzzle |
| Alternative Judges | Reward reading the game state, not just drafting |

### Ongoing Effect Power Level

| Effect Type | Power | Reasoning |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| +1 bonus to style | Medium | ~3-4 extra points per round if playing that style |
| -1 cost | High | Enables chains that were previously impossible |
| Conditional points | Variable | Depends on playstyle alignment |

The ongoing effects are meaningful but not game-breaking. A player who claims The Minimalist in Round 1 might get +5 cards over the game (draw 1 × 5 rounds)—strong, but not insurmountable.

### Missing Judge Concepts

Some ideas not included that could be added for expansion:

| Concept | Requirement Idea | Why Excluded |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| The Duelist | Win crowd favor against each opponent at least once | Player-count dependent; complex tracking |
| The Comeback Kid | Win crowd favor on beat 8 after failing execution earlier | Too narrow; encourages bad play |
| The Trendsetter | Have another player style-match you 3+ times | Depends on opponents; feels bad to pursue |
| The Curator | Refine 4+ cards in one round | Anti-fun; sitting out of the game |
