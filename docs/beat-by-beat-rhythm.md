# Beat by Beat — Rhythm Card Reference

*Per-Beat Rhythm Deck*

---

## Overview

The Rhythm deck contains **80 cards** that modify individual beats throughout the game. Each game uses 48 cards (6 rounds × 8 beats), meaning roughly 60% of the deck is seen per game.

**Composition:**
- 48 Blank cards (flavor text, no mechanical effect)
- 32 Effect cards (modify costs, bonuses, recovery, or other mechanics)

**Effects per game (expected):** ~19 (roughly 3 per round)

---

## Setup

1. Shuffle the full 80-card Rhythm deck
2. Deal 8 cards face-up in a row (Round 1)
3. Deal 8 cards face-down below them (Round 2 — revealed at end of Round 1)
4. Remaining rounds are dealt as the game progresses, always one round ahead

**Visibility:** Players always see the current round and the next round's Rhythm cards.

## Statistical Expectations

### Per Game (48 cards drawn)

| Metric | Expected Value |
|--------|----------------|
| Blank cards | ~29 |
| Effect cards | ~19 |
| Effects per round | ~3.2 |

### Effect Distribution per Game

| Category | Expected per Game |
|----------|-------------------|
| Cost modifiers | ~6 |
| Bonus modifiers | ~6 |
| Recovery modifiers | ~4 |
| Crowd/Chain modifiers | ~3 |

### Variance

With 80 cards and 48 drawn, roughly 60% of the deck appears each game. This means:

| Scenario | Likelihood |
|----------|------------|
| A specific 2-copy card appears at least once | ~75% |
| A specific 1-copy card appears | ~60% |
| A round has 0 effects | ~10% |
| A round has 5+ effects | ~8% |

## Design Notes

### Blank Card Philosophy

The 48 blank cards serve multiple purposes:

1. **Pacing:** Not every beat is special; this creates rhythm
2. **Unpredictability:** Players can't count cards to know what's left
3. **Cognitive load:** Fewer decisions per round
4. **Thematic:** Flavor text reinforces the dance atmosphere

### Effect Balance

**Unconditional effects** (38%) ensure everyone can benefit sometimes, preventing feel-bad moments where a player's deck never aligns with Rhythm cards.

**Type-conditional effects** (38%) reward deck composition without being as narrow as style requirements. Since Types are spread across all styles, any focused deck will hit some of these.

**Special conditions** (25%) create memorable moments and reward adaptive play.

### Potentially Swingy Cards

Some cards can create large advantages:

| Card | Swing Potential | Mitigation |
|------|-----------------|------------|
| Second Nature | Very strong late game | Only 1 copy; requires repeat plays |
| Signature Move | +3 is huge | Only works on cost 5; high risk |
| Underdog Moment | Inverts normal strategy | Only 1 copy; still requires success |
| Combo Breaker | Can hurt leaders | Affects everyone equally |

These are intentionally rare (1 copy each) to create exciting moments without dominating.

### Missing: Style-Conditional Effects

I deliberately avoided style-conditional Rhythm cards (e.g., "-1 cost for Latin moves"). Reasoning:

1. With 5 styles, a "Latin bonus" beat helps ~20% of players' decks
2. Creates feel-bad moments for players who drafted differently
3. Type conditions are more inclusive (Step appears in every style)

If you want style-conditional effects, they could be added as rare, powerful cards (1-2 copies each). For example:

| Card Name | Effect | Copies |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Latin Heat | -2 cost for Latin moves | 1 |
| Ballroom Elegance | +2 bonus for Ballroom moves | 1 |
| Classical Grace | -2 cost for Classical moves | 1 |
| Jazz Hands | +2 bonus for Jazz moves | 1 |
| Street Cred | -2 cost for Street moves | 1 |

This would add 5 cards (85 total), with each appearing in ~60% of games.

## Optional Variant: Curated Songs

For groups who want predictable round structures, pre-define "songs" as specific 8-card Rhythm layouts:

**"Slow Burn"**
| Beat | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
|------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Card | Blank | Blank | Light Feet | Blank | Blank | Crowd Pleaser | Blank | Second Wind |

**"All Eyes on You"**
| Beat | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
|------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Card | Crowd Pleaser | Blank | Blank | Tough Crowd | Blank | Blank | Blank | Signature Move |

**"Technical Showcase"**
| Beat | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
|------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Card | Blank | Spin Cycle | Blank | Take Flight | Blank | Picture Perfect | Blank | Blank |

Players can select 6 songs before the game or draw randomly from a song menu.

## Quick Reference

### Timing

Effects apply only to the beat they're revealed on. Cost modifiers apply during Execute phase; Bonus modifiers apply during End of Round scoring; Recovery modifiers apply during Recovery phase.

### Stacking

If multiple effects could apply to the same move (e.g., Light Feet + Footwork Focus for a Step move), they stack.

### Crowd Favor Modifiers

These replace the normal crowd favor rules for that beat only. "Tough Crowd" and "Underdog Moment" change who wins; "Standing Ovation" changes the tie rule.

### Edge Cases

| Situation | Resolution |
|-----------|------------|
| Second Nature + never played this card | No discount (must be a repeat) |
| Familiar Ground + tie for most-played style | Player chooses which style counts |
| Underdog Moment + tie for lowest | Same as normal ties—nobody wins |
| Combo Breaker + Momentum same round | If on same beat, Combo Breaker wins; otherwise each applies to its beat |
