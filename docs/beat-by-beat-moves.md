## Statistical Analysis

### Deck Economy

**Starting state:**
- 10-card starter deck
- Initial draft: +3 cards (keep 3 of 5)
- Opening deck: 13 cards

**Recovery action budget:**
- 48 beats × 1 action = 48 recovery actions (plus bonus actions from Rhythm cards)

### Hand Pressure per Round

| Phase | Cards Out | Cards In | Net |
|-------|-----------|----------|-----|
| Start of round | — | Draw 5 | +5 |
| 8 beats played | -8 | — | -8 |
| Execution costs (good chains) | -4 to -8 | — | -4 to -8 |
| Stamina actions (~4 per round) | — | +8 | +8 |
| **Round balance** | | | **-3 to +1** |

With good chains, players roughly break even. Broken chains create heavy card pressure.

### Realistic Action Distribution

| Playstyle | Stamina | Inspiration | Refinement | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Conservative | 60% (29) | 25% (12) | 15% (7) | Prioritizes not Stumbling |
| Balanced | 50% (24) | 30% (14) | 20% (10) | Middle ground |
| Aggressive | 40% (19) | 40% (19) | 20% (10) | Risks Stumbles to draft more |

### Deck Size Projection: Draw 3, Keep 1

| | Conservative | Balanced | Aggressive |
|--|--------------|----------|------------|
| Starting | 10 | 10 | 10 |
| Initial draft | +3 | +3 | +3 |
| Inspiration | +12 | +14 | +19 |
| Refinement | -7 | -10 | -10 |
| Stumbles | +1 | +2 | +4 |
| **Final deck** | **~19** | **~19** | **~26** |

Players add ~12-19 cards, remove ~7-10, netting +5 to +12 cards.

### Deck Size Projection: Draw 3, Keep 2 (Recommended)

| | Conservative | Balanced | Aggressive |
|--|--------------|----------|------------|
| Starting | 10 | 10 | 10 |
| Initial draft | +3 | +3 | +3 |
| Inspiration | +24 | +28 | +38 |
| Refinement | -7 | -10 | -10 |
| Stumbles | +1 | +2 | +4 |
| **Final deck** | **~31** | **~33** | **~45** |

With buffed Inspiration, decks grow significantly larger, enabling stronger style focus.

### Style Acquisition Probability

With Draw 3, Keep 2 Inspiration:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Target style % of pool | ~17% |
| Cards seen per Inspiration | 3 |
| Expected target style per Inspiration | 0.5 |
| Total Inspirations (balanced player) | ~14 |
| Total cards seen | ~42 |
| Expected target style cards seen | ~7 |
| Expected target style cards kept | ~4-5 |

**Judge feasibility:** With a requirement of "4 [Style] + 4 Any," a focused player can realistically achieve this through drafting + multi-style cards.

### Buffed Inspiration Trade-offs

| Benefits | Drawbacks |
|----------|-----------|
| Faster style accumulation | Deck dilution (less consistency) |
| Denial mechanic (keep 2 = deny 1) | Judges may become too easy |
| Each Inspiration feels impactful | Common Pool depletes faster |
| Easier to pivot mid-game | Larger decks cycle slower |
| Stumbles diluted in bigger deck | Reduces pressure to chain well |

### Common Pool Depletion

With 4 players using Draw 3, Keep 2:

| Inspirations per Player | Total Cards Drafted | Pool Remaining |
|------------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| 5 | 40 | 80 |
| 10 | 80 | 40 |
| 15 | 120 | 0 (reshuffles) |

The pool will reshuffle approximately once per game with 4 aggressive players.

## Design Notes

### Cost/Bonus Philosophy

High cost ≠ high bonus. This creates strategic diversity:

| Strategy | Card Profile | Example |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| Crowd Chaser | High cost, moderate bonus | Triple Spin (cost 5, bonus 4) |
| Point Farmer | Low cost, decent bonus | Cucaracha (cost 2, bonus 1) |
| Chain Builder | Low cost, zero bonus | Basic Salsa (cost 1, bonus 0) |
| Specialist | Mid cost, high bonus | Arabesque (cost 3, bonus 2) |

### Type Theming by Style

Each style emphasizes certain types for thematic coherence:

| Style | Primary Types | Secondary Types |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| Latin | Step | Spin, Flow |
| Ballroom | Step | Spin, Pose |
| Classical | Flow, Pose | Jump, Spin |
| Jazz | Jump | Step, Spin |
| Street | Step, Flow | Pop |

This creates natural synergies with Type-based Rhythm cards.

### Multi-Style Balance

Multi-style cards are intentionally:
- Concentrated at cost 2-3 (connectors, not showstoppers)
- Slightly lower bonus scores (max 3, not 4)
- Covering all style pairs reasonably

This makes them valuable for Judge flexibility without being strictly better than styled cards.

### Recommended Configuration

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Styles | 5 | ~17% each, focused drafting viable |
| Cards per style | 20 | Enough variety, not overwhelming |
| Multi-style cards | 20 | Strong wildcard presence |
| Starter deck | 10 styleless | Clean baseline for all players |
| Inspiration | Draw 3, Keep 2 | Meaningful choices, denial mechanic |
| Judge requirement | 4 [Style] + 4 Any | Achievable with focus |

---

## Quick Reference

### Cost Formula
Discards required = Cost − 1 − Discounts

### Chaining Discount
If previous move succeeded AND previous cost ≤ current cost → discount = previous cost

### Crowd Favor
Highest cost among successful moves wins (ties = nobody wins)

### Recovery Actions
- **Stamina:** Draw 2 from personal deck
- **Refinement:** Remove 1 card from hand or discard
- **Inspiration:** Draw 3 from Pool, keep 2, discard 1 to common pile

### Judge Example
"4 Latin + 4 Any" = In one 8-beat round, successfully execute 4 Latin moves and 4 of any style (including more Latin or multi-style counting as Latin)
